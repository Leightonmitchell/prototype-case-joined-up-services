# [Prototype] Business case for joining up government services

## Introduction

A team at the Government Digital Service are prototyping a concise business case to help join up government services. We're publishing changes each week during our [Discovery](https://www.gov.uk/service-manual/agile-delivery/how-the-discovery-phase-works), which runs from February to March 2020. We will update this prototype, as we learn more about the cost of disjointed government services, their impact on users and government.

This is an early prototype. There will be mistakes, and inaccuracies. Please tell us. We hope by [making this open, we will make it better](https://www.gov.uk/guidance/government-design-principles#make-things-open-it-makes-things-better).

We hope by referencing key decisions, and the evidence behind them, that you'll see how we reached the conclusions. The evidence comes from ongoing user research interviews and data analysis, as well as previous Discoveries. Your feedback is important to take this from a prototype to an effective business case. You can give us feedback by raising an issue, or opening a pull request. You can also DM [@vosageroll](https://twitter.com/vosageroll) on Twitter.

If you are publishing, use the [template for prototyping a business case](https://github.com/alphagov/prototype-case-joined-up-services/blob/master/template/template-prototype-business-case.MD) as a guide for writing, then make a pull request on the [prototype](https://github.com/alphagov/prototype-case-joined-up-services/blob/master/prototype-business-case-joined-up-services.MD).
